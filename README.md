CMSC 434 Project

Our project was created using Google Slides.  Our group was not experienced in creating a website and preferred to create the applicaiton in Android.  After considering that the application was originally designed for the desktop and after taking our Professor's insight into account, we created a series of html scripts for the final prototype.
